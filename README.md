# MusicTheoryHTML
HTML pages with css and JS files to aid any beginner with guitar lessons
I myself found a need for these kind of pages while learning
so I created them for myself and still refer to them when needed

To use these pages just clone the repository and open any HTML file.
or you can see them at https://celestial-shoelace.cloudvent.net/
